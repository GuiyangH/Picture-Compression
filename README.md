# Picture Compression
## Introduction
A little gadge in Matlab that I use to compress pictures for fast trainning speed on images.
## Files:
findCentro.m: Iteratively find centroids of data points in order to create clusters.

findidx.m: find indices of centroids in given images.

opt_Kmean.m: the Kmean algorithm for clustering.

PictureCompress.m: The main part that connects all.
